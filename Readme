Hello , Iam Vennela.
In this repository , I tried to trace a mobile number's location using Python modules like Geopy,Folium,Geocoder and Timezone.
The Interface is Developed using Python Tkinter module.
Folim is used to show the location on Maps.
Nominatim is used to determine the latitude and longitude of the location.
Timezone Identifies the Country.
